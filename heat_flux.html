      This was an idea after taking a class in Electrodynamics and seeing Marco Reps' video on [Knicks Heat Flux Meter].
      After searching a little I've came across a paper about heat flux measurements using TEMs modules which assured this was quite possible.
      After designing the analog signal amplifier, filters and connections the only thing left was to find the right linear relationship between
      TEM output voltage and heat flux. For this I used Fourier's law in one dimension and the relationship between thermal resistance and 
      thermal conductance, I did the approximations based on 27 degrees celsius normal surface temperature. And got the parameters for my current
      TEM module from another paper that experimentally measured the parameters: seebeck coefficient, thermal resistance and electrical resistance.
      I will link all the related papers and my calculations in a seperate page dedicated to this project.
